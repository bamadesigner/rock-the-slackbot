# Rock The Slackbot
Rock The Slackbot is a WordPress plugin that helps you stay on top of changes by sending notifications straight to you and your team inside your Slack account.

*You can also [download this plugin from the WordPress.org plugin repo](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rock-the-slackbot/).*

## What is Slack?
[Slack](https://slack.com/is) is a team collaboration tool that offers chat rooms organized by topic, as well as private groups and direct messaging. It's a great way to be productive with your team without clogging up your inbox.

## What is A Slackbot?
[Slackbot](https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202026038-Slackbot-your-assistant-notepad-programmable-bot) is Slack's built-in robot, which helps us send messages to you and your team inside your Slack account.

## Why Rock The Slackbot?
Because it can help you manage your websites, and stay on top of changes, by sending notifications (following numerous WordPress events) to your Slackbot who will pass them along to a channel or direct message in your Slack account.

**Rock The Slackbot is multisite-friendly.**

**Rock the Slackbot sends customizable notifications** for the following events:

* When a post is published
* When a post is unpublished
* When a post is updated
* When a post is deleted
* When a post is trashed
* When a 404 error is thrown
* When a menu item is deleted
* When media is added
* When media is edited
* When media is deleted
* When a user is added
* When a user is deleted
* When a user's role is changed
* When a plugin, theme, or core update is available
* When a plugin, theme, or core is updated

**I'm working to add the following events:**

* When menu item is added
* When a new comment is added or is awaiting moderation
* When plugins or themes are uploaded
* When plugins or themes are activated

**Each event can be customized to allow you to send different event notifications to different Slack channels**, e.g. you can send core, theme and plugin updates to your "wp-development" channel while all of your post changes go to your "wp-content" channel.

Please use [the Issues section of this repo](https://github.com/bamadesigner/rock-the-slackbot/issues) to suggest features, like other notification events.

**A Slack account is required to use this plugin** and is free to use for as long as you want and with an unlimited number of people. [Visit the Slack website](https://slack.com/) to learn more and sign up.

## Send A Simple Slack Message

You can use the `rock_the_slackbot_send_webhook_message` action to send a simple message to your Slack account.

**The function accepts the following parameters:**

1. $webhook_id_or_url - provide the webhook URL or the ID of one stored in settings
2. $message - the message you want to send
3. $channel - OPTIONAL - the channel you want to send message to. Prefix with # for a specific channel or @ for a specific user. Will use default channel if nothing is passed.

```
// Use this action to send a simple message to Slack
do_action( 'rock_the_slackbot_send_webhook_message', '564d3c1cdf52d', 'this is a test', '#testchannel' );
```

## Filters

Rock The Slackbot has filters setup to allow you to tweak each WordPress notification before it's sent. You can setup a filter for all notifications or drill down by event or specific webhook.

**Each notification filter passes three arguments:**

1. $notification - an array containing the notification information: webhook URL (the URL for your Slack account) and the payload (all of the information being sent to Slack) for the notification
2. $notification_event - the slug of the notification event
    * Will be false if you send a custom Slack notification that doesn't involve a WordPress event
3. $event_args - an array containing notification event specific information
    * Will be false if you send a custom Slack notification that doesn't involve a WordPress event

**See *Notification Events* below to learn which information is passed to the filters for each notification event.**

### Filter all WordPress notifications
    add_filter( 'rock_the_slackbot_notification', 'filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification', 10, 3 );
    function filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification( $notification, $notification_event, $event_args ) {

        // Change the pieces

        // Return the notification
        return $notification;
    }

### Filter WordPress notifications by webhook ID
    // You can find the ID for each of your webhooks on their edit screen in the admin
    add_filter( 'rock_the_slackbot_notification_(webhook_id)', 'filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification_webhook', 10, 3 );
    function filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification_webhook( $notification, $notification_event, $event_args ) {

      // Change the pieces

      // Return the notification
      return $notification;
    }

### Filter WordPress notifications by event slug
    // The event slugs are listed below
    add_filter( 'rock_the_slackbot_notification_(notification_event)', 'filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification_event', 10, 3 );
    function filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification_event( $notification, $notification_event, $event_args ) {

      // Change the pieces

      // Return the notification
      return $notification;
    }

### Filter all outgoing webhook payloads that are sent to Slack

Whether it's a WordPress notification or a simple Slack message, all messages to Slack are sent as a payload in an outgoing webhook. This filter allows you to change any payload sent to Slack in an outgoing webhook.

    add_filter( 'rock_the_slackbot_outgoing_webhook_payload', 'filter_rock_the_slackbot_outgoing_webhook_payload', 10, 2 );
    function filter_rock_the_slackbot_outgoing_webhook_payload( $payload, $webhook_url ) {

        // Change the payload

        // Return the payload
        return $notification;
    }

## Filter Examples

You can use a filter to change the Slack notification to go to a different Slack channel according to post information, like the post category:

    add_filter( 'rock_the_slackbot_notification', 'filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification', 10, 3 );
    function filter_rock_the_slackbot_notification( $notification, $notification_event, $event_args ) {

        // Only run filter for specific events
        switch( $notification_event ) {

            // This way you can set which events you want to use
            case 'post_published':
            case 'post_unpublished':
            case 'post_updated':
            case 'post_deleted':
            case 'post_trashed':

                // Get category names
                $categories = wp_get_post_categories( $event_args[ 'post_id' ], array( 'fields' => 'names' ) );

                // Replace 'CategoryName' with the category you're looking for
                if ( in_array( 'CategoryName', $categories ) ) {

                    // Change the channel in the payload
                    // Make sure you prefix the channel name with #
                    $notification[ 'payload' ][ 'channel' ] = '#newchannel';

                }
